Mcdonalds is okay, Its not like we dont know what we're getting, but they discontinued their sweet chilli sauce and i cant let them get away with that. What i really
need is a Wendys and Mcdonalds hybrid like tacobell keeps doing with every other resturaunt. Lets not be silly here, Mc'Ds chicken is much better.
